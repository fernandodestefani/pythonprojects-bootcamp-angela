## ðŸ›  Skills & Concepts Applied

Projects cover a wide range of skills, including:

- âœ… **Graphical Interfaces:** Interactive experiences built using `turtle` and `tkinter` for games, utilities, and data visualizations.  
- âœ… **API Integration:** Access to real-time data through public APIs (e.g., sending motivational quotes via SMS, tracking habits, crypto price updates).  
- âœ… **Automation & Scripting:** Streamlined workflows using Python scripts for web scraping, file organization, and task scheduling.  
- âœ… **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Clean, modular code architecture using OOP principles.  
- âœ… **Data Persistence:** Use of CSV files, JSON, and external APIs to store and retrieve user data.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each project is stored in its **own folder**, containing a dedicated README file with:

- A project description  
- Instructions to run the code  
- **âœ¨ Screenshots or GIFs âœ¨** demonstrating functionality (if applicable)
